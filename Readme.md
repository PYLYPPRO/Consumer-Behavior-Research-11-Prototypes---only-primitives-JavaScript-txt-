2. Attitudinal Segmentation (Factor Analysis Simulation)
Method: Attitudinal Segmentation using Factor Analysis Simulation. 
Focus: Grouping students based on their psychological attributes, beliefs, and motivations (e.g., attitude towards career, study methods, cost sensitivity). 
This is more powerful than simple demographics for content targeting. Factors: 5 dimensions representing core educational attitudes.

4. Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Simulation
Method: Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Simulation (Simplified Linear Regression). 
Focus: Assessing the Return on Investment (ROI) and effectiveness of various marketing channels (e.g., paid digital, SEO, events) on enrollment volume. 
This allocates budget efficiently. 
Factors: Budget allocated to 3 primary marketing channels.

6. LMS Engagement Heatmap Score
Method: Engagement Heatmap Scoring (Weighted Moving Average). Focus: Calculating a single, dynamic engagement score based on recent and frequent LMS activity. 
Crucial for real-time risk assessment. Factors: Recency, Frequency, and Depth of LMS interaction.

7. Price Elasticity of Demand Simulation
Method: Price Elasticity of Demand Simulation. 
Focus: Determining how sensitive student enrollment volume is to changes in tuition price. Essential for tuition strategy and forecasting revenue. 
Factors: Baseline price, new price, and corresponding enrollment figures.

9. Time Series Forecast (Enrollment)
Method: Simple Exponential Smoothing (Time Series Forecasting).
Focus: Predicting future enrollment based on historical trends, giving more weight to recent data.
Factors: Historical enrollment data and a smoothing factor (alpha).

<img width="708" height="547" alt="199999-099" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55155cfe-f51a-4df6-861f-638c0d3036bd" />

11. Decision Tree Classification
Method: Simplified Decision Tree (Rule-Based Classification). 
Focus: Implementing a simple, highly interpretable decision pathway (tree) to classify students based on a few sequential rules. 
Excellent for operationalizing decisions. Factors: 3 binary/categorical factors representing key thresholds.

12. Customer Effort Score (CES) Simulation
Method: Customer Effort Score (CES) Simulation. 
Focus: Measuring how easy it is for students to interact with the institution's services (e.g., registration, technical support). 
High effort often leads to frustration and churn. 
Factors: Student ratings on four interaction dimensions.

13. Service Blueprinting Simulation
Method: Service Blueprinting Simulation (Focusing on Touchpoints). 
Focus: Analyzing the quality of key interaction touchpoints from the student's perspective. 
Essential for service design and quality control. 
Factors: Rating of various front-stage and backstage interactions.

14. Marketing Attribution Simulation
Method: Marketing Attribution Modeling (Simple U-Shaped). 
Focus: Distributing credit for a student's enrollment across multiple marketing touchpoints. 
Crucial for understanding channel true value and avoiding misallocation of budget. 
Factors: 3 key touchpoints in the student journey.

15. Propensity Score Matching Simulation
Method: Propensity Score Matching (PSM) Simulation. 
Focus: Simulating the calculation of a treatment effect (e.g., the impact of a specific retention intervention) by comparing similar treated and untreated groups. 
Crucial for validating retention strategies. 
Factors: Binary outcome and two confounding variables.
